### Stress-aware analysis of MEF2C regulatory programs in microglia

Stress aware reanalysis of MEF2C regulatory programs in microglia, integrating bulk regulatory genomics and single cell stress modeling to distinguish technical artifacts from true biological signals. 

This repository contains an exploratory, stress-aware analysis of MEF2C-associated regulatory programs in microglia.  
The analysis examines the relationship between MEF2C-linked transcriptional programs and dissociation-induced stress signals.

Bulk regulatory genomics from MEF2C-perturbed human microglia are analyzed alongside independent single-cell microglia data used to characterize technical stress effects.  
Comparisons are performed at the level of gene programs and pathways.

## Stress and MEF2C program visualization

The figure below shows a low-dimensional embedding of single-cell microglia colored by dissociation stress score and by MEF2C-associated gene program score.

This visualization illustrates differences in how dissociation stress signals and MEF2C-associated programs are distributed across the embedding.

## Notes

This repository is intended to support transparent analysis and cautious interpretation of MEF2C-associated transcriptional programs in the context of dissociation-related technical effects.
